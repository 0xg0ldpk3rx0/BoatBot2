__notes:__
- the duration is set to `0` for a permanent ban
- acceptable duration modifiers are `H` for hours and `D` for days
- examples of acceptable durations: `24H`, `30D`, `0`
- uid: user id
- sid: server id
- to get the ids of users, servers, you need to enable developer mode in discord
- `Lbanuser` and `Lwarnuser` will send PMs to the user stating the duration and reason
- `Lbanserver` and `Lwarnserver` will send a message to the server and the server owner containing the duration and reason
- You cannot erase disciplinary history; everything you do will be recorded in a manner similar to audit logs. The only way to remove any note is for me to manually remove the database entry.
- All of these commands require owner-admin permissions, so non-supportbot staff people can't use these commands. (They shouldn't be able to.)
- A ban is when SupportBot stops reading the banned entity's messages.
- A warning is a reminder to the user/server to follow our rules.
- A note does not notify the user/server.
- Server Permabans may result in SupportBot auto-leaving the server.
